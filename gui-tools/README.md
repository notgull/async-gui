# gui-tools

`gui-tools` is a common interface to the windowing/graphics systems for various operating systems.

The Rust ecosystem is made up of crates like `winit`, `theo` and `accesskit` that require some level of interopability to be used together. In addition, the Rust GUI ecosystem is prone to evolve; in two weeks, we might be using a different crate entirely. `gui-tools` is a layer over all of these systems to provide a distinct API and a combination of features that are common to all of them.
